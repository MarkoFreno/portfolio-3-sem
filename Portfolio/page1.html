              <h5>Flatmate concept</h5>
              <p>Flatmate was a concept of our own. I developed it with another student, which has been teaching me a lot about getting more comfortable in javascript. The coding part of it was a huge lesson in itself. According to UX it was also very hard accomplished on testing.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>The solution</h5>
              <p>Flatmate was a solution that was gonna differentiate from other roomie and apartment companies, by grouping members of the same interests. The design was made to be plain and simple and with very much testing, we got a good solution that would fit in to our target-users needs.</p>

          <h5>Different task</h5>
          <p>Mediac Agency was an exceptionel experience, but also quite difficult. Mediac Agency would show their target audience, that they were more than just computernerds, so we made them some SoMe posts, and in that way created a lot of value, showing them as different persons with a video, and some specific tone of Voice.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>instructive</h5>
          <p>The aspects that made Mediac Agency a very strange task, was because it was the first B2B company we've worked with. This made the perspective to the target audience a lot more unique compared to other projects from the past. From that project I have learned to engage, and approach such projects with a different view.</p>

            <div>
              <h5>Research</h5>
              <p>Otto Moensted was a dorm with a few hundred people living there. The case was to create a solution to their needs for activities, washingmachinetimes and whatsoever. We gathered information from Facebook forums mainly, which we used as output in our analysis.</p>
            </div> 
          </div>

          <div class="otto-item">
                        <div>
              <h5>Analysis</h5>
              <p>We made it for both desktop and mobile, because the survey we made resulted in a large number if mobile-users. We also asked what the users could find relevant, and they mainly told us about the washingmachinetimes, but we could also conclude that an event calender was a need for more of the people living there.</p>

            <div>
              <h5>Result</h5>
              <p>Last but not least we made a helping section, because people often happend to be in need of help. It was either about moving something, borrowing something (a hammer ex) or just help with school. So the way we solved the user-needs, was from testing different AB tests on the target audience, until we had something for every demand.</p>
